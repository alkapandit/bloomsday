              We started with a mission to organize all documents in the
              homebuying process – which, more broadly, is a way of bringing
              together likeminded people who want to be chill in an otherwise
              stressful situation.  An important part of doing so is for
              everyone to know that they, and what they provide, are valued,
              respected, and guarded.  You can expect the following:

                homes, or can improve our Products or the experience for
                homebuyers or homeowners in your area – nothing more.  We
                periodically review the information that we hold.  If we deem
                any information to be nonessential, we remove it.

              We may collect personal data about you, although this generally
              depends upon the particular service that you use.  This
              information comes to us either because you provide it or because
              we obtain it from a third party.  Personal data includes your
              name, email address, phone number, and fax number.  For example,
              our Products are designed to be used in the homebuying process,
              when sensitive or detailed information may be shared with us
              because it is a part of documents used to buy a home.  This kind
              of personal data can include your signature, social security
              number, bank account information, your current address and the
              address of your home.  We also collect credit and debit card
              information and other payment information in connection with
              payment for our Products. Additionally, we may collect technical
              information from you, such as the domain used for access; IP
              address of your host server; name and version of web browser;
              date, time, and place of access; internet address of any site
              viewers; page views; and time spent on any page.  We may also
              collect information about the device that you use and your
              approximate location, though you can generally disable our ability
              to obtain this information through your device’s settings.

              Document Repository.  When you buy a home, you will receive a lot
              of documents.  Like, A LOT.  Our Products are designed to collect
              all of those documents.  It is also designed to collect all
              versions of those documents, so that you can review changes across

              Our intention is only to use your information in service of our
              Basic Principles.  Specifically, this includes:

            <ul class="list-disc ps-8 sm:pb-10">
              <li>
                To provide the Products to you and customize your experience. 
                For example, when you create an account, you provide information
                to us that allows us to create your profile.  Your activity
                within our Products allows us to maintain service and make
                ongoing recommendations.
              </li>
              <li>
                To improve our services.  Learning about the use of our Products
                – by you alone or by the collective “you” (i.e., you and others
                like you) – helps us when developing new services or
                troubleshooting potential problems with existing services.
              </li>
              <li>
                To ensure the integrity of our Products.  For example, to
                detect, prevent, or respond to security incidents; to detect,
                prevent, or respond to illegal or potentially illegal activity;
                to fight spam; and to protect the legal rights of us and other
                users of our Products.
              </li>
              <li>
                To ensure the integrity of our data.  The proper functioning of
                our Products assumes that the underlying information is correct,
                which information generally comes from our users.  Where
                possible, we may corroborate or supplement that information with
                information from other sources.
              </li>
              <li>
                To communicate with you.  We strive to give every customer
                valuable, personalized service.  We may identify ways that you
                may be able to use our Products better or other products and
                services that may be useful to you – and we’d like to be able to
                share that with you through notifications in the platform or by
                email or text message.  Although we only intend for this kind of
                communication to be helpful, we understand that some may
                categorize it as spam and don’t want any part of that.  If you
                do not want these kinds of communications, you can opt out in
                your settings.  We still reserve the right to communicate with
                you about your account.

                a need to know and in order to accomplish a specific,
                pre-defined goal.  In all instances, we refer these parties to
                this privacy policy.
              </li>
              <li>
                To third-party vendors.  We identify trusted partners who
                provide important services to make our Products run well for
                you, to allow for payment processing (so that we can keep the
                lights on), to market our Products, to analyze our Products, and
                other products and services that we reasonably determine that we
                need to accomplish our business’s objectives.  As above, we
                refer these parties to this privacy policy.  We also seek to
                include confidentiality provisions in our contracts with
                third-party vendors, so they are required to treat our (and
                your) information as carefully as they treat their own secrets.
              </li>
              <li>
                To meet legal and regulatory requirements.  We do not look
                kindly upon requests for our data from anyone, and our first
                impulse upon such a request is to resist it.  However, we will
                comply with any valid subpoena, court order, or search warrant. 
                Additionally, we may affirmatively report conduct on our
                Products (and the user to whom such conduct is attributed) to
                the government when we believe that our Products are being used
                for illegal or illicit purposes; there is an emergency; or there
                is the risk of imminent death or injury.
              </li>
              <li>
                To facilitate a business transaction.  If we choose to merge
                with another company, to sell all or a part of us, to facilitate
                any change of control transaction – or, if we, gulp!, go
                bankrupt – our information (which includes your information) is
                likely to be one of the key assets that would transfer or be
                purchased.  If we sell our equity or secure loan financing,
                potential investors and financiers may also be interested in
                reviewing our information as a part of due diligence.  In any of
                these circumstances, we would likely enter into a
                confidentiality agreement requiring that our acquirer or
                investor treat our (and your) information as carefully as they
                treat their own secrets.  After any of these transactions, your
                information will continue to be subject to this privacy policy,
                consistent with its terms.
              </li>

                use of our Products.  We take steps to aggregate and anonymize
                such data so that it cannot be reasonable tied back to any
