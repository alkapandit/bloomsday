              Our mission at Bloomsday is to turn homebuying and homeownership
              into acts of mindfulness. To do that, we have built this platform
              and its related products and services, all of which we call our
              “Products.” These terms and conditions govern all of the Products
              that we offer, unless we explicitly state that these terms and
              conditions do not apply. By accessing or using our Products, you
              agree to these terms and conditions in their entirety. <span class="font-semibold">If you
              disagree with anything in these terms and conditions - from the
              substance of a provision to the placement of a comma - you should
              not use our Products.</span>

              We are a digital company run by people with an analog mindset. 
              The purpose of our Products is to help you collect and make sense
              of your real estate documents.  That way, during a very stressful
              time, you can use your brain to make reasoned judgments in line
              with your values, instead of to remember where that one piece of
              paper went.  To do so, our Products include the following for you:
            </p>
            <p class="pb-5">
              Document Repository.  When you buy a home, you will receive a lot
              of documents.  Like, A LOT.  Our Products are designed to collect
              all of those documents.  It is also designed to collect all
              versions of those documents, so that you can review changes across
              drafts.
            </p>

            <p class="pb-5">
              Date Tracker.  Real estate documents often have dates imbedded in
              them.  Some are given as dates:  “January 1, 2023.”  Others are
              given as legalese:  “Two weeks following the Inspection Date.” 
              Our Products decipher all of this into a schedule of events that
              interactively changes as the underlying documents may change.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-5">
              Notes to Self.  Our brains are highly contextual.  Certain
              important facts only come to us when we’re in certain contexts. 
              That’s why we remember that our flashlight needs batteries when
              the power goes out, instead of when we’re walking beside batteries
              for sale.  We created a place to jot down and track these
              thoughts.  That way, you can remember what’s important to you in a
              home before closing, instead of later on when you realize that
              certain something isn’t there.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-5">
              Continual Access.  We’ll always keep your information in place for
              your easy access, whether that’s right before you return to work
              after lunch, or at 2:00 am when you wake up wondering, “Did we
              remember to include that thing?”

              Continual Improvement.  We are always trying to make our Products
